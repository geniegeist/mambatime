# mambatime

This repo contains a Mamba2-Attention-backbone for timeseries. 
mambatime is designed to be trained on a single node (e.g. 4xA100) via the train.py script.

It is heavily inspired by [Karpathy's nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat) and the official [mamba implementation](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba).
